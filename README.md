# Indego-Analysis-using-Python
This project uses Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and matplotlib, etc to analyze trip data for Philadelphia's bike-sharing platform Indego. The data has been obtained from Indego's 
official website. Although the data is clean to an extent, additional cleaning was performed to make it appropriate for analysis. The data files used for analysis are too large to host 
here, they can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vScBI8_oudVPZGK4oqrDMA3fb1jeN-uf?usp=share_link
